<summary><h2>Description</h2></summary>
It works like a normal snake game code;
The apple spawns randomly in pixel range of 100,100 to 1200,700.

While i can Change it so that the spawn range varies across display size. I added a feature that automatically changes the display ratio. That specific ratio defines the apple spawn range.

Also I added some music, SFX and visuals on the buttons.

Overall I hope you enjoy my game and you are free to use my code as a template.:smiley:

<summary><h2>Setup</h2></summary>
1. To use my game first install my files as a zip.
Or clone with this link: https://github.com/greeenboi/Snake-Game.git

2. Then once downloaded into your system or venv, Ensure that the text file 
`screensize.txt` is intact and has the exact value _1280*720_ inside it *(I will add a program called debug.py to automate this functionality soon)*

Then on your preferred code editor run main.py and The game should work!:tada::grin::tada:
